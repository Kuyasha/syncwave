Project Title:

SyncWave | A Realtime Chat Application


---
Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js(Hooks+Context API), , JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

Backend/Services: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Hosting), Firebase Security Rules

Other Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Netlify/Vercel (for testing or alternate deployment)

Description:

I designed and developed a full-featured real-time chat application using React.js and Firebase, focused on seamless user experience, authentication, and efficient message handling. This project was built to demonstrate my skills in full-stack web development, particularly real-time communication, state management, and cloud-based backend integration.

The app enables users to sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication (Google OAuth), send and receive real-time messages via Cloud Firestore, and view the online/offline status of other users. The application features a clean and responsive UI, optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

Firebase’s real-time database and hosting made it possible to manage dynamic content with minimal latency. I used React Hooks and Context API for state management, and Firebase Security Rules to ensure secure access to user data and messages.

Key Features:

Authentication:

Integrated Firebase Google OAuth login and logout system.

Ensures that only authenticated users can access chat functionality.


Real-Time Messaging:

Messages are synced instantly across devices using Firestore’s real-time database.

Display of chat timestamps and automatic scrolling to the newest message.


User Status and Presence:

Online/offline status detection using Firebase's Realtime Database or Firestore.

Optional typing indicators for active chats.


Responsive UI/UX:

Built using CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries to support all screen sizes.

Chat bubbles, user avatars, and timestamps for better usability.


Security & Performance:

Firestore security rules implemented to restrict unauthorized access.

Minimal re-renders and optimized Firebase queries for improved performance.


Hosting:

Deployed on Firebase Hosting or Vercel with fast load times and free SSL.

Project Outcome & Learning:

This project helped me deepen my understanding of real-time data flow, component-based UI development in React, and backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solutions. It gave me hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and modern web applications without needing to set up a traditional backend server.

I also gained valuable practice in responsive design, authentication logic, and cloud deployment—skills that are directly applicable to real-world full-stack web development roles.
